# Description:
Our goal with this project was to help out the community and build them something impactful during these difficult times. Many local Mom and Pop shops don't have a decent website or application that let the consumers know about their services. This is an application for such small businesses. In this app the owners gets a basic application where they can add their own products and services to showcase and in return help them improve their business. We had a great time trying to build this application and we hope you enjoy using it too.
